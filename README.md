SignalGraph is a Matlab-based tool for building directed acyclic graphs (DAG) for signal processing. The original purpose is to perform deep learning on speech signals on the Matlab platform for fast development. It should also be applied to other tasks, especially involving temporal trajectory data. 
It supports several common types of neural networks, such as feedforward deep neural networks (DNN), long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN, currently only support temporal convolution which is the 1-dimensional convolution). 
It also supports common signal processing modules, such as extracting of MFCC features, overlap-and-add for speech enhancement, extraction of generalized cross correlation (GCC) from multi-channel waveforms, etc. 
I will try to implement more signal processing and neural network types in the future.
