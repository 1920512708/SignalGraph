# Introduction
Each node in the computational graph is called a node or layer. There are input nodes, output nodes, cost function nodes, etc. 
Each node need to have two functions, i.e. the forward pass and backward pass (back-propagation). Some nodes, such as short time fourier transform, only have forward pass function because we don't need the backward pass now.
